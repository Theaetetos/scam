1.2-5

* estimate.scam: Extended Fellner Schall optimizer for smoothing parameter selection is now available using scam(...,optimizer="efs") as in gam(mgcv). But rather than minimizing REML (in gam(mgcv)) it minimizes GCV criterion.

* bfgs_gcv.ubre: bug fixed to avoid zero eigenvalues. Thanks to Pierre Masselot for reporting the bug.


1.2-4

* scam.control: function added. This allows control of the numerical options for fitting a SCAM in the similar way as gam.control(mgcv). scam, scam.fit, estimate.scam, bfgs_gcv.ubre, gcv.ubre_grad, check.analytical routines were corrected to account for scam.control setting.

* linear.functional.terms.Rd: examples corrected.

* scam: setting 'devtol'/'steptol' values corrected. Thanks to Haibo Chen for reporting the bug.

* scam: setting 'weights' corrected. Thanks to Haibo Chen for reporting the bug.

* scam: scam setup is changed. clone of the gam setup of gam(mgcv). 

* *.Rd: examples for bivariate smothing constructors updated.


1.2-3

* scam.Rd: example with random effect corrected. Thank you to Alan Cobo-Lewis.  

* smooth.construct: three tensor product smoothing constructors for bivariate functions subject to shape constraints were added: 'tecxcx','tecvcv', 'tecxcv'. Thanks to Leire Citores for bringing this up.

* summary.scam: corrected summary info for the test statistic and p-value for very small edf. Also removed line for the score info in case of supplied sp value.

* scam-package.Rd: updated content to be in sync with the actual package metadata in the DESCRIPTION file.



1.2-2

* print.scam, summary.scam: changed the printing info about edf, they are now rounded up.

* logLik.scam: function added (clone of logLik.gam (mgcv)). Thanks to Jorge Guevara for raising a question about that.

* scam: bug fix with manually setting knots of the spline. Example added to smooth.construct.mpi.smooth.spec.Rd file. Thanks to Matthew Harris for reporting the issue.  

* formula.scam: function added, returns the scam formula. Thanks to Renke von Seggern for reporting the bug.

* scam.check: bug fix with setting 'pch' explicitly. Thanks to Renke von Seggern for reporting the bug.

* plot.scam: bug fix with plotting the residuals which had a shift of an intercept. Thanks to John Kornak for reporting the bug.


1.2-1

* bfgs_gcv.ubre, estimate.scam: bug fix with supplying the value of 'gamma' which was overridden by a default 'gamma=1'. Thanks to Phil Boonstra for reporting the bug and providing an example.

* smooth.construct: a univariate positively constrained smooth, 'po', was added.

* added 'linear.functional.terms' with shape constraints example to an Rd file (see linear.functional.terms(mgcv))


1.2-0

* smooth.construct: six tensor product smoothing constructors for bivariate functions subject to shape constraints were added: 'temicx','temicv', 'tedecx', 'tedecv', 'tescx', 'tescv'. Thanks to Linda Mhalla for bringing this up.

* anova.scam: added (clone of anova.gam (mgcv)). Thanks to Felix Meyer for raising a question about that.

* plot.scam: fits are now centralized (by subscracting the mean of the smooth term)



1.1-9

* scam.r, bfgs.r, estimate.scam.r, check.analytical.r: corrected environmental variable

* plot.scam: can now plot random effect smoother. Thanks to Ondřej Mikula for bringing up the issue.
  plot.scam is now a clone of the 'new' version of plot.gam().

* predict.scam: type="iterms" is added to return standard errors for unconstrained smooth components that include the uncertainty about the intercept/overall mean ("iterms" was commented in an .Rd file of the previous versions but not implemented) 
Thanks to Ondřej Mikula for reporting the issue

* S3 methods predict.scam residuals.scam are registered now (in 'NAMESPACE' file)

* scam: corrected use of an 'offset' variable, the one that is outside of the formula. Previously it was not recognized by scam. Thanks to Amy Morin for reporting the bug and providing an example. 


1.1-8

* summary.scam: corrected dimension of the variance matrix Vb which sometimes sent an error

* scam.fit: bug fix with coding the term 'QtQRER' needed for the fitting procedure

* scam-package: the EPSRC NCSE grant is acknowledged in the \reference section



1.1-7

* bug fix in scam which could fail when the smoothing parameter values are supplied in 'sp'
          argument to 'scam'. ('sp' values supplied to the smooth term 's' are ignored by 'scam')
          Thanks to Noel G. Cadigan for reporting the bug.

* References fixes in .Rd files



1.1-6

* Namespace, Description fixed

* vis.scam: added, copied from vis.gam(mgcv) 

* scam: added additional returned elements of the fitted scam object: `aic', `df.residual', `df.null', `min.edf', object$call (needed for update to work), 'var.summary' (needed for vis.scam), `R', `edf1'.
   added keepData argument as input, if FALSE (default) the original data removed to save space. 
   removed object$X (model matrix) from return/output list to save space. model.matrix() added as in gam(), correspondingly summary.scam() and predict.scam() were corrected to replace object$X by model.matrix(object). 

* scam.fit: `Rrank' is now an exported object of mgcv 

* scam.check: added extra graphics parameters (...) to pass to plotting functions (like pch,cex);  added qqline() with colours in qqnorm() plot

* plot.scam: corrected number of plots per page and plotting any parametric terms when "all.terms=TRUE" as in plot.gam() (although plot.scam is based on the old version of plot.gam()).

* derivative.scam: this function replaced derivative.smooth(). It
works only for univariate smooths at the moment, with finite differencing approximations for unconstrained smooths.

* summary.scam: corrected the value of the adjusted R-sq as in gam(mgcv), fixed Ref.df to be the same as in summary.gam(),
  the code was corrected to be in line with summary.gam()

* scam.fit.post: corrected the value of the null deviance, added the null degrees of freedom, removed the value `TRUE' for intercept to correct the values of the deviance explaned and null.df for models without intercept.

* extrapolate.uni.scam: this function has been removed from the package since predict.scam does linear extrapolation



1.1-5

* Predict.matrix.**.smooth 

For all univariate and bivariate SCOP-splines Prediction method now allows prediction outside range of knots, and use linear extrapolation in this case



1.1-4

* scam.fit: svd replaced with QR + svd if needed approach, 
  large number of O(nq^2) products that were not needed removed, removal of multiple un-necessary loops.

* gcv.ubre_grad tidied, terms collected in derivative of trace (8 goes to 6), derivative of trace computations restuctured to reduce O(nq^2) operations from 6 per derivative to 4 up front.

* predict.scam: line for reference to extrapolate.uni.scam corrected with "if.. " for uni case only
